# Post It All : Chrome Extension
###### Add sticky notes to your favorite web pages.

Notes will be loaded automatically each time you visit the page again.

The notes can be created in the same page or in the extension Dashboard page, and can be blank notes or with the selected text on the page. Notes can be filtered by domain, web page or without filter. There are lots of possibilities!

All notes are stored by using the Chrome Storage API. There are some advantages with it like the automatically sync of your notes between browsers, and some limitations with the data storage quota (https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/storage#property-sync).
